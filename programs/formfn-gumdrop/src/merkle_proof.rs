//! These functions deal with verification of Merkle trees (hash trees).

//! The initial implementation for Solidity based Ethereum contracts is here:
//! https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0/contracts/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol
//!
//! That was then ported to Solana by the Saber Team:
//! https://github.com/saber-hq/merkle-distributor/blob/master/programs/merkle-distributor/src/merkle_proof.rs
//!
//! The Saber code was then used directly in the Metaplex Gumdrop implementation
//! which served as the basis for the current bullistic-gumdrop program.

/// Returns true if a `leaf` can be proved to be a part of a Merkle tree
/// defined by `root`. For this, a `proof` must be provided, containing
/// sibling hashes on the branch from the leaf to the root of the tree. Each
/// pair of leaves and each pair of pre-images are assumed to be sorted.
