/**
 * This function is responsible for running shared logic and some assertions
 * before all tests, which includes the following:
 *
 * - Setup SDK and provider Connection.
 * - Setup and fund test wallet keypairs.
 * - Mint a new master edition NFT.
 * - Create the GumdropConfig account.
 * - Create a new new distributor program for the newly created mint.
 *
 * It also runs some assertions during the GumdropConfig setup and
 * NewDistributor setup. It's a bit tricky to separate the setup steps
 * and test assertions without duplicating code, which is why they are combined
 * here.
 *
 * Each test generally assumes it is starting with a newly created distributor
 * and a new mint, which is why this setup is run multiple times.
